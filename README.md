# Girl-in-Red
Hello hello!
I am Rola, a cybersecurity enthusiast on a journey to master ethical hacking and Red Hat Linux.
I am currently in my third year studying ComSci all the way in Tokyo!


In this repo, I will keep track of my progress as I work towards becoming red hat hacker; hence, "girl in red". 

Goals:
- build a daily habit of learning and coding
- Complete 30 hands-on security mini-projects.
- Document everything I learn for my future self to refer to
  - Also for my future self to look back and see how far she's come
- learn to become a red hat hacker
- add to my journey in cybersecurity
- do something i love
- have fun :)
