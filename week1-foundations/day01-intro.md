# Day 1: Kickoff & Setup ðŸš€

## What I Did Today

- Created my new GitHub repository: **Girl in Red**
- Wrote my first README to explain my goals and the purpose of this challenge
- Set up a project board and table to track my milestones (using both board and table views)
- Learned about the importance of keeping my repo organized
- Gained a better understanding of working with GitHub and Markdown files

## Thoughts & Reflections

I'm excited (and a little nervous!) to start this 30-day journey into ethical hacking and cybersecurity. Setting up my GitHub felt empowering and new, and Iâ€™m looking forward to learning something more and more every day. I want to make this repo a true reflection of my growth and interests.

## Plan for Tomorrow

- Install Linux virtual machine
- Document the installation process in a new markdown file (like this one :))
- Write a brief summary of what I learn during the installation
- Document, analyse and keep track of errors and diffculties I encounter and how I overcome them
