# Day 2: Kali Linux: setting it up and what it is

## What is Kali Linux? How about we start there?
According to the [Kali Linux website](https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/what-is-kali-linux/) itself, Kali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution which allows users to perform
or -I guess in our case- practice penetration testing and security auditing. 

## But where do we run it?
Kali linux runs on many platforms and is quite accessible. However, given that I am wokring on a Mac, I am running it on [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
### Installation process and booting
I personally installed VirtualBox and Kali Linux on my device a long time ago. What I would recommend, however, is for you to look up the installation process on YouTube, and you will
find a plethora of videos and guides available on there. 

When you boot Kali Linux, you need to open VM and **make sure everything is in the same folder**. When you launch VM, you can start Kali and it should look like this:

### Now what?
Well, here is the real deal... working with Kali Linux and setting up. Moreover, what do we do now?

Well now is when I show you my journey with it :)

1. I pressed on "Graphical Install" to help me set up the GUI
2. I set up the time, language, network and login details (username and password)
3. After setting everything up, I waited for the software installation to complete ... it took a while ... a long one :(
4. aaaand... an installation step failed :( so now what?

   a. time to troubleshoot... of course, I had to look it up on the internet

   b. I tried GRUB install, but that too didn't work

   c. Next step was, installing without boot loader ... and that was SUCESSFUL! ðŸŽ‰
5. KALI LINUX IS FINALLY RUNNING WOOHOO ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Our next step (day 3)?
Now we gotta learn how to navigate, and we will leave that to tomorrow. 
See you on Day 3!

Love,
